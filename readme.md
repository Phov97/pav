For the design i used a css grid. to help me create the css grid layout to make it responsive i used a variety of resources online:

To develop the css animation, i carried out some research using online resources and the module materials provided to us. I used these as a guide and played around and changed the code around to change the shape of the object and the colour, as well as the direction the object moves in.

I also created a css response image grid as this will allow the images to be viewable on smaller screen sizes as the layout will change. To create this i used w3schools example as a guide to follow and played around with the code again. As they used screen size as max width, i format the code and changed it to suit the min-width css code to make it function according the purpose of the grid

I added a wiki search bar to the podcast page. This gives users a chance to research into podcasts if they want to find out more. i used lab material for this but understood what the code functions do. I also removed and changed the features which i did not need, such as the language options column and the thumbnails. as this didn't apply to my goals for the website.
